      <p><strong>The Battle of Trench was a 30-day long 
    siege of Yathrib (now Madinah) fought between
     the Muslims and the confederates of the Quraysh and Jews
    . While the Muslim army comprised only 3,000 soldiers,
     the opponents were 10,000 strong.</strong></p>
     <h2>Digging of the Trench</h2>
     <p><strong>When the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT heard the news 
        that the Jews and Quraysh were lobbying against the Muslims,
         he called his companions to strategize.
    Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) started taking suggestions and that is 
    when Salman Farsi (RA) told him to dig a trench around the 
    northern boundary of Madinah as the other sides are covered 
    with mountains and dense forests.<br>

        Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) divided the 
        Muslims into groups of ten and asked them to dig a trench.
         It is narrated that the Messenger (PBUH) of Allah SWT, 
         while digging the trench, said, “This is Quraysh’s last attempt
          to destroy Islam and Muslims, and from now on, 
          we will rule over them.”</strong></p>

             <h2>Facts about the Battle of the Trench</h2>
             <p><strong>1&nbsp;.&nbsp;  The battle of Trench took place in 5AH.
              <br>2&nbsp;. &nbsp; Salman Farsi RA gave the suggestion of digging the trench around 
              the city of Madinah, these trenches were dug in 6 days.
              <br>3&nbsp;. &nbsp;The miracle took place at Jabir RA’s house.<br>
             4&nbsp;.  &nbsp; Mount Dhubab (Also known as Mount Ra’yah) was the place 
              where Prophet Muhammad PBUH was stuck under a large rock, 
              <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; which was broken down into pieces and emitted light. After seeing this light, Prophet PBUH congratulated
               Muslims on the upcoming <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; victory over Persia, Yemen, and Syria.
                It was the place where Masjid Ra’yah is located.<br>
                5&nbsp;. &nbsp;Due to trenches, Enemy forces were unable to enter the city of Madinah.<br>
                6&nbsp;. &nbsp; Ali Ibn Abi Talib (RA) killed Amr, who was one of the top enemy commanders 
                and regained the charge of the area called sila.<br>
                7&nbsp;.&nbsp; To the south, Muslim Women and Children were attacked by Banu Qurayaza.
                 Their houses were horsed by Banu Qurayaza.<br>
                8&nbsp;.&nbsp; When Prophet Muhammad PBUH came to know that Muslim women and children are being attacked in the south,<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sent 
                 the army to protect them, which also defeated the Banu Qurayaza there.<br>
                 9&nbsp;.&nbsp; Nuaym ibn Masud, who was well respected by the enemy tribes came to Prophet PBUH and told him that he had accepted Islam.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
                 Also offers his help to Muslims, Prophet PBUH asked him to break the trust of Confederates and Banu Qurayaza.
                 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuaym went back to Banu Qurayaza and told them that Muslims are going to win this battle, he advises them to keep Banu Qurayza <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safe is to give some leaders given as a hostage to Banu Qurayza.<br>
                  10&nbsp;. &nbsp;Nuaym went to Confederates’ leader Abu Sufyan and warned him that Banu Qurayza is forming an alliance with Muslims again,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this caused a big mistrust between these two groups and that also became a reason why 10,000 lost to 3,000.<br>
                  11&nbsp;.&nbsp; Prophet PBUH prayed and asked Allah to destroy the Confederates for good. Allah sent down a wind, possibly a storm <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which took away everything that belonged to enemy forces.<br>
                  12&nbsp;. &nbsp;Masjid Fatah was the place where Prophet PBUH prayed to Allah to defeat the enemy forces.
